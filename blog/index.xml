      <description>Online presence is key, especially now, to showcase your skills and express your thoughts and ideas inS form of blogs or articles. Having your own personal website gives you credibility when someone is searching for your name. In this post, I’m going to discuss the benefits of writing on your own website. Writing is one of the easiest ways to get started, as you need only time with no expensive tools.</description>

      <description>Coming from a pentesting background and having led many Red Team engagements for over 15 years, I’m noticing changing industry trends with respect to vulnerability, red teaming, and other technical assessments.
Until recently, there was a huge demand for technical assessments as organizations were required to test and validate security issues by third-party vendors, as mandated by compliance requirements by PCI, HIPAA, and Sarbanes–Oxley This trend will still continue but not as much as it used to be.</description>

      <description>Questions below showcases fictional use cases. Please use you own experience and stories while preparing for an interview.
Why you chose to get into Pen Testing
As an individual, I like to constantly learn new things. With penetration testing, I have always liked the idea of playing a vital role in identifying potential breakpoints across the applications and infrastructure and explore new ways to secure the environment.
As the ecosystem is dynamic, and new technologies have been emerging, it helps me to maintain enough adrenaline rush, to resolve interesting industry challenges – securing environments across industries.</description>

      <description>Understanding Red Team Assessments Red Team Objectives The key objective of the exercise would be to simulate real threats designed to leverage weaknesses in people, process and technology to compromise the target environment. This would typically include the following areas:
 Intelligence gathering and reconnaissance Social engineering, including phishing techniques, use of safe malware infected IOT devices, and physical penetration testing Wireless and network penetration testing of internal and external systems Enterprise application assessments to determine whether weaknesses in applications may provide opportunities to gain unauthorized access to information and / or resources  The ongoing information security breaches at companies worldwide have shown that once perimeter defenses are breached, the company’s crown jewels can be obtained.</description>

      <description>This document discusses the approach or methodology for the cryptosystem library that could be utilised by web applications, web services, REST based web service, file transfer for encryption and decryption. This proposed cryptosystem offers the following built-in features:
· Authentication – Using this cryptosystem, the identity of the remote system or application can be established. For example, SSL certificate of a web server providing proof of the identity of the remote system.</description>

      <description>Following are my notes on common security issues that were identified based vulnerability scanning or penetration testing
OS Command Injection Description: An OS command injection attack occurs when an attacker attempts to execute system level commands through a vulnerable application. Application uses system level commands to do some functionality. In this, web interface is used to execute OS command on a web server. Any web interface that is not properly sanitized is subject to this exploit.</description>
